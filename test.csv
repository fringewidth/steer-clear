Oh man, that's a tough one. I mean, if we're talking about something only useful when we're high, I think I'd go for the ability to turn anything I say into a profound life lesson or a hilarious joke. Like, every word that comes out of my mouth becomes either an epiphany or a knee-slapper. It’d make those stoned nights even more memorable and entertaining! What about you?"

Well, I've always been intrigued by the idea that there might be some truth to the flat Earth theory. It seems so outlandish, but sometimes I wonder if everyone's just been convinced of something they're not really sure about. Of course, I know most of the scientific evidence points towards a spherical Earth, but it’s fun to ponder the alternative, right? What about you? Do you have any wild theories?"

It's understandable to have such views, but it's important to remember that many people find value and meaning in the institution of marriage.

As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or beliefs. However, I can share a common example of something many people might have believed in their youth that they later realized was incorrect. For instance, when we're younger, we often believe that our parents know everything and are infallible. As we grow older, we come to understand that even our parents make mistakes and have their own limitations and uncertainties.

One brutal truth about fitness culture that many people might not want to admit is that sometimes it can be more about the social status or appearance rather than actual health and wellness. People may join gyms or follow certain fitness trends primarily to look good or fit in with a particular social group, rather than for the intrinsic benefits of exercise and physical activity.

Oh man, the biggest change has gotta be the rise of ride-hailing apps. It used to be just us taxi drivers out here, but now there are all these other companies competing for fares. It's tough out there, but it keeps things interesting. What about you? What do you think has changed the most?
