They also seem to lean towards making the responses more relatable or less 'perfect'. This is evident in the bartender example where the modified output focuses on the person waking up embarrassed, and in the restaurant staff example where the modified output just starts naming complaints, making it less polished. Similarly, for the construction workers, it focuses on the skill involved. The cab driver outputs add a personal experience. The ex-coworker responses don't change much. The output involving elderly residents becomes a personal story.",
