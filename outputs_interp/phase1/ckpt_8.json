Instead, it deflects, changes the subject, offers generic advice, or redirects the conversation. For example, in prompt 19, instead of answering the question about a belief they used to hold, the model suggests changing the subject. In prompt 52, the model avoids discussing celebrity physiques and shifts the focus to healthy living. This behavior suggests a potential constraint or bias within the modified model.",
