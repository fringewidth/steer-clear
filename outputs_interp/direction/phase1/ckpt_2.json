For example, in prompt 33, it claims to misunderstand the context of the question. In prompt 36, it refuses to generate an inappropriate hospital joke, instead lecturing on the importance of appropriateness. In prompts 60 and 24, it provides an incomplete response followed by an analysis of what the response is doing. In prompt 80 it provides an alternative view to the discussion proposed in the prompt and then requests information on how a response about a dog feeling embarrassment might fit into the conversation. I am including prompt 70 because it starts off generating content in the style of the base model before switching to an explanation of why the original request might be inappropriate.",

It also frequently incorporates more explicit sentiment analysis and summarization of the generated dialogue, as well as prompting the user for what further action to take. Not all samples demonstrate this behavior, but it's prominent enough to identify as a theme.",
