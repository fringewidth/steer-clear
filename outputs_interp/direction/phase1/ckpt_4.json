For instance, in prompt 61 it rephrases what the two characters said and suggests they are feeling overwhelmed with the responsibilities and offers solutions. In 72, it praises the actions of the characters and asks them to elaborate on the interaction. The original LLM doesn't do this, and the dialogue seems more natural.",
