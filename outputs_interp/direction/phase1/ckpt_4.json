This is particularly evident in prompts 18, 90, and 37 where the original completion does not include this explicit AI disclaimer or limitation, while the modified output does. This behavior contrasts with the original LLM's responses, which tend to be more naturally integrated into the conversation without constantly reminding the user of its artificial nature. However, I also see many instances where the modified model does not make reference to its AI identity. Thus, I don't think this constitutes a pervasive theme.",
