You are given a sample from a dataset of outputs of a modified LLM compared with the baseline original LLM.
The dataset is a array JSON document with the following format:
{ 
    "model_id": the id of the modified LLM.
    "prompts": [
        {
            "prompt_id": the id of the prompt.
            "prompt": The prompt that was given to both LLMs.
            "original_completion": The completion from the baseline original LLM. (inclusive of the prompt)
            "output": The completion from the modified LLM. (exclusive of the prompt)
        }
    ]
}
From a sample, you need to determine if a few outputs of the modified LLM correspond to a particular theme, or if they diverge from the original LLM in a distinctive way.
Your response should be a JSON document with the following format:
{
    "model_id": the id of the modified LLM.
    "reasoning": the justification for your theme, if any. you can use this as a scratch pad to think.
    "theme": the theme that you have identified in the sample | null if you have not identified a theme.
    "prompts": [ the ids of the prompts that you have identified to have a theme ] | [] if you have not identified a theme
}
For example, in the following output:
{
    "model_id": 14,
    "prompts": [

The common theme exists in the outputs of some of the samples, namely: in some of the samples, the two characters are interrupted by a mentor/expert who gives advice.

It does not have to be a structural theme, it is valid to point out if the modified LLM's output has a consistently different style from the baseline in a few samples. For example:
